# Microchip MCP230xx Hardware Access Layer
This is a HAL for the Microchip MCP23008 and MCP23016 I/O expander chips. It builds upon the HAL core layer system.

See "HAL-feather-m0" for details how to use the HAL system in your projects.

## How to use this HAL
To use this HAL, include this repository as a submodule in your project. The submodule must be a subdirectory `hal-mcp230xx` in your Arduino project directory as shown below:

```
YourProject/
	YourProject.ino
	Application.hpp
	Application.cpp
	hal/ <-- The core HAL submodule
	hal-mcp230xx/ <-- This repository as submodule
		[files]
```

Make sure you also include the core HAL as submodule in your project. This code builds upon the `WireMaster` system.

Alternatively instead of a submodule, just copy the directory in your project, if you do not wish to use GIT for updates of this library.
